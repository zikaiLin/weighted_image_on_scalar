- `preprocess_abcd_bl.R`: Baseline ABCD sociodemographic preprocessing. This R script is designed for preprocessing baseline demographic data collected in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Its primary functionalities include recoding variables, re-categorizing data, and handling missing values in the demographic tables of the ABCD baseline dataset.
- `abcd_imaging_reweight.R`: Imaging sample reweight. This script is used for the sample weights recalibration of imaging samples. It's employed to estiamte the pseudo-probabilities of inclusion post imaging quality control (n = 3782), relative to the original ABCD baseline cohort (n = 11875, comprising 9905 complete cases).
